# discord-bot-valorant-tracker
Discord Bot project

A Discord bot that pulls Valorant player stats from the Tracker Network API, then makes them easy to browse in Discord. It supports on demand lookups, account linking per user, and per server leaderboards.

Example use cases: show a player’s lifetime KD and recent matches, link a Discord user to a Riot ID so they can use short commands, build a leaderboard for everyone in a server that has linked their account.
